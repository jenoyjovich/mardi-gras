                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the mouth of the Mississippi
                        River in what is now lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville,
                        Bienville,
                        and their men celebrated it as part of an observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first
                        celebration of the festivities in New Orleans is unknown. A 1730 account by Marc-Antione Caillot
                        celebrating with music and dance, masking and costuming (including cross-dressing). Excerpt | A
                        Company Man - The Book An account from 1743 that the custom of Carnival balls was already
                        established. Processions and wearing of masks in the streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were
                        sometimes prohibited by law, and were quickly renewed whenever such restrictions were lifted or
                        enforcement waned. In 1833 Bernard Xavier de Marigny de Mandeville, a rich plantation owner of
                        French descent, raised money to fund an official Mardi Gras celebration.</p>

                    <p>
                        In 1856 21 businessmen gathered at a club room in the French Quarter to organize a secret
                        society to
                        observe Mardi Gras with a formal parade. They founded New Orleans' first and oldest krewe, the
                        Mystick Krewe of Comus. According to one historian, "Comus was aggressively English in its
                        celebration of what New Orleans had always considered a French festival. It is hard to think of
                        a
                        clearer assertion than this parade that the lead in the holiday had passed from French-speakers
                        to
                        Anglo-Americans. ... To a certain extent, Americans 'Americanized' New Orleans and its Creoles.
                        To a
                        certain extent, New Orleans 'creolized' the Americans. Thus the wonder of Anglo-Americans
                        boasting
                        of how their business prowess helped them construct a more elaborate version than was
                        traditional.
                        The lead in organized Carnival passed from Creole to American just as political and economic
                        power
                        did over the course of the nineteenth century. The spectacle of Creole-American Carnival, with
                        Americans using Carnival forms to compete with Creoles in the ballrooms and on the streets,
                        represents the creation of a New Orleans culture neither entirely Creole nor entirely American."
                    </p>

                    <p> In 1875 Louisiana declared Mardi Gras a legal state holiday. War, economic, political, and
                        weather conditions sometimes led to cancellation of some or all major parades, especially during
                        the
                        American Civil War, World War I and World War II, but the city has always celebrated Carnival.
                    </p>

                    <p> In 1979 the New Orleans police department went on strike. The official parades were canceled or
                        moved to surrounding communities, such as Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. Significantly fewer
                        tourists
                        than usual came to the city. Masking, costuming, and celebrations continued anyway, with
                        National
                        Guard troops maintaining order. Guardsmen prevented crimes against persons or property but made
                        no
                        attempt to enforce laws regulating morality or drug use; for these reasons, some in the French
                        Quarter bohemian community recall 1979 as the city's best Mardi Gras ever.</p>

                    <p> In 1991 the New Orleans City Council passed an ordinance that required social organizations,
                        including Mardi Gras Krewes, to certify publicly that they did not discriminate on the basis of
                        race, religion, gender or sexual orientation, to obtain parade permits and other public
                        licenses.
                        Shortly after the law was passed, the city demanded that these krewes provide them with
                        membership
                        lists, contrary to the long-standing traditions of secrecy and the distinctly private nature of
                        these groups. In protest—and because the city claimed the parade gave it jurisdiction to demand
                        otherwise-private membership lists—the 19th-century krewes Comus and Momus stopped parading.
                        Proteus did parade in the 1992 Carnival season but also suspended its parade for a time,
                        returning
                        to the parade schedule in 2000.</p>

                    Several organizations brought suit against the city, challenging the law as unconstitutional. Two
                    federal courts later declared that the ordinance was an unconstitutional infringement on First
                    Amendment rights of free association, and an unwarranted intrusion on the privacy of the groups
                    subject to the ordinance.The US Supreme Court refused to hear the city's appeal from this
                    decision.</p>
                    <p>
                        Today, New Orleans krewes operate under a business structure; membership is open to anyone who
                        pays
                        dues, and any member can have a place on a parade float.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>LaToya Cantrell (born April 3, 1972) is an American politician serving as the Mayor of New
                        Orleans,
                        Louisiana, a post she has held since May 7, 2018. Cantrell, a Democrat, is the first black woman
                        to
                        hold the post. Before becoming mayor, Cantrell represented District B on the New Orleans City
                        Council from 2012–2018.</p>
                    <h3>Early life and education</h3>
                    <p>Cantrell was born as LaToya Wilder in Los Angeles. She moved to New Orleans in 1990 to attend
                        Xavier University of Louisiana, where she earned a BA in sociology. She attended an executive
                        training program at the Harvard Kennedy School.</p>
                    <h3>Broadmoor neighborhood work</h3>
                    <p>Cantrell returned to New Orleans in 1999, settling in the Broadmoor neighborhood. In 2003, she
                        joined the board of the Broadmoor Improvement Association and became president of the
                        association in 2004. After the 2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans following Hurricane
                        Katrina, the Broadmoor neighborhood flooded severely and remained mostly deserted for months
                        afterward. In early 2006, the Bring New Orleans Back Commission, a blue-ribbon panel convened by
                        then-mayor Ray Nagin, released a recovery plan that called for Broadmoor and five other New
                        Orleans neighborhoods to be converted into greenspace.] In her role as president of the
                        association, Cantrell worked with residents and local religious leaders to organize opposition
                        to the panel's recommendation. She also helped enlist returning Broadmoor residents in a
                        six-month effort to write a recovery plan for the neighborhood</p>
                    <p>Cantrell worked full time to implement Broadmoor's recovery plan from 2006 through 2012. She and
                        fellow residents formed the Broadmoor School Board, overseeing the reopening and renovation of
                        the Andrew H. Wilson school. She served as a founding board member of the Broadmoor
                        Development Corporation, a community development corporation that provided case management and
                        other social services for returning residents.She was involved with residents' efforts to
                        reopen Broadmoor's Rosa F. Keller Library, which won a $2 million grant from the Carnegie
                        Endowment. She created a partnership between the Broadmoor Improvement Association and
                        Church of the Annunciation, which provided the neighborhood association with office space and
                        hosted volunteer groups. She also formed a partnership between the Broadmoor Improvement
                        Association and her home parish, Blessed Trinity Catholic Church, to open the Broadmoor Art and
                        Wellness Center.</p>

                    <p>The devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005 caused a few people to question
                        the
                        future of the city's Mardi Gras celebrations. Mayor Nagin, who was up for reelection in early
                        2006,
                        tried to play this sentiment for electoral advantage. However, the economics of
                        Carnival were, and are, too important to the city's revival.</p>


                    <p> The city government, essentially bankrupt after Hurricane Katrina, pushed for a scaled back
                        celebration to limit strains on city services. However, many krewes insisted that they wanted to
                        and
                        would be ready to parade, so negotiations between krewe leaders and city officials resulted in a
                        compromise schedule. It was scaled back but less severely than originally suggested.</p>

                    <h2>Tradition Colors</h2>
                    <p>The colors traditionally associated with Mardi Gras in New Orleans are green, gold, and purple.
                        The
                        colors were first specified in proclamations by the Rex organization during the lead-up to their
                        inaugural parade in 1872, suggesting that balconies be draped in banners of these colors. It is
                        unknown why these specific colors were chosen; some accounts suggest that they were initially
                        selected solely on their aesthetic appeal, as opposed to any true symbolism.</p>

                    <p> Errol Laborde, author of Marched the Day God: A History of the Rex Organization, presented a
                        theory
                        that the colors were based on heraldry: all three colors correspond to a heraldic tincture, and
                        Rex's goal may have been to create a tricolor to represent their "kingdom". Purple was widely
                        associated with royalty, while white was already heavily used on other national flags, and was
                        thus
                        avoided. Furthermore, he noted that a flag in green, gold and purple in that order complies with
                        the
                        rule of tincture, which states that metals (gold or silver) can only be placed on or next to
                        other
                        colors, and that colors cannot be placed on or next to other colors.</p>

                    <p> Following a color-themed Rex parade in 1892 that featured purple, green, and gold-colored floats
                        themed around the concepts, the Rex organization retroactively declared that the three colors
                        symbolized justice, power, and faith. The traditional colors are commonly addressed as purple,
                        green, and gold, in that order—even though this order violates the rule of tincture.</p>

                    <h2>Throws</h2>
                    <p>A 'throw' is the collective term used for the objects that are thrown from floats to
                        parade-goers. Until the 1960s, the most common form was multi-colored strings of glass beads
                        made in Czechoslovakia.</p>

                    <p>Glass beads were supplanted by less expensive and more durable plastic beads, first from Hong
                        Kong, then from Taiwan, and more recently from China. Lower-cost beads and toys allow
                        float-riders to purchase greater quantities, and throws have become more numerous and common.

                    <p> In the 1990s, many people lost interest in small, cheap beads, often leaving them where they
                        landed on the ground. Larger, more elaborate metallic beads and strands with figures of animals,
                        people, or other objects have become the sought-after throws. David Redmond's 2005 film of
                        cultural and economic globalization, Mardi Gras: Made in China, follows the production and
                        distribution of beads from a small factory in Fuzhou, China to the streets of New Orleans during
                        Carnival.The publication of Redmon's book, Beads, Bodies, and Trash: Public Sex, Global
                        Labor, and the Disposability of Mardi Gras, follows up on the documentary by providing an
                        ethnographic analysis of the social harms, the pleasures, and the consequences of the toxicity
                        that Mardi Gras beads produce.</p>

                    <p> In addition to the toxicity of tons of plastic, eye injuries from Mardi Gras parade throws are
                        commonplace, and more severe injuries—such as a fractured skull in an infant struck by a
                        coconut—have also been known to occur.</p>

                    <p> With the advent of the 21st century, more sophisticated throws began to replace simple metallic
                        beads. Krewes started to produce limited edition beads and plush toys that are unique to the
                        krewe. Nowadays yelling the phrase “throw me something mister!” means you could catch a huge
                        assortment of items with fiber optic beads and LED-powered prizes, medallions, doubloons and
                        soft toys among the most sought-after items. In a retro-inspired twist, glass beads have
                        returned to parades. Now made in India, glass beads are one of the most valuable throws.
                        However, the most commonly associated throws are still strings of plastic beads.</p>
